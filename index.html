    <h1>Worker Thread Example</h1>
    <main>
      <p>
        As we know JavaScript is a single threaded application, most of the io
        intensive async tasks are delegated via event loop, but if there are any
        cpu intensive tasks that needs to be run on the main thread javascript
        will show blocking behavior. To make this non blocking we can utilize
        worker threads.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example shows how we can utilize worker threads to handle cpu heavy
        calculations. If you click the main thread button, it will count till
        ten billion and you can not change the background color (blocking
        behavior). But if you click on the worker thread button, it will run the
        same tasks on the worker thread but you can change the background color
        (non-blocking behavior). You can open the console for better
        understanding.
